    // missing but the right children are present or the left parents are missing but the right parnets
    // already have children or just there are gaps in the array
    // height of complete binary tree= log(n)

    // Heap
    // Max heap's parents are always greater than or = its children and the root is the largest element
    //Min heap's parents are smaller than its children, root is the smallest element
