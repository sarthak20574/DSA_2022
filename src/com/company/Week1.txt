Arrays:

Online: An algorithm that can process and maintain sorted order, without having the entire input
 available from the start.
In-place: An algorithm that transforms input using no additional data structure, overwriting the
input itself. However, a small constant extra space used for variables is allowed. Selection sort
in an In-place sorting algorithm.

Example: If the input can only be read once and you have to sort it as you go, you need an online sorting algorithm.

Sieve of Eratosthenes
This is an important technique to find all the prime numbers from 1 to N in  (N(log(logN))) time.
If this is done naively, it would take O(NâˆšN) time.
